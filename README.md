# Data_Structures
3-SEM Core Subject
Data Structures is a core subject in my 3rd semester that focuses on organizing, storing, and managing data efficiently so it can be accessed and modified effectively. The course builds a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, which is essential for software development and technical interviews.

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stacks and Queues

Recursion

Trees (Binary Trees, BST, Traversals)

The course was taught by Dr. A D Sawarkar, whose lectures emphasized both conceptual understanding and practical implementation.
